    <p>
        Before we met in person, you sent me a list of restaurants for me to choose from for our first date, and
        from then, I knew that I was going to like you. During our first FaceTime call, prior to meeting in person,
        I was in awe of how handsome you were. The first words I said were your hair is symmetrical and you look
        like a model. I knew then, that I could stare at you for hours, and get lost in your beautiful blue eyes
        that would make even the bluest waters in the islands jealous.
        <br>
        <br>

        During our first date, we realized that we had a lot in common, despite our differences in upbringing
        physically, emotionally, and culturally. We talked about our love for travel, our hang gliding experience in
        Brazil, and many more. I only anticipated on spending two hours with you, but we ended up getting lost in
        time, and spending the entire evening together. It was a Sunday, 10/29/23, so I had work the next day. I got
        home at 10:02pm, and I joked about how I should have called out, so that I could spend more time with you,
        and to recover, after a fun evening, and a few drinks. I had a lot of firsts that evening. I do not kiss
        people or show affection due to past experiences, but I kissed you on the first date. I always wanted to try
        an
        espresso martini, and I ended up trying, and liking it, on our first date. After that date, I found myself
        texting you all day everyday, even while at work. It did not matter what time of day it was or what our work
        obligations entailed, we always responded to each other within 1-2 minutes. That is when I knew that I liked
        you.
        <br>
        <br>

        I was always told not to put all my eggs in one basket, but I liked you so much that I was willing to take
        the risk and do that anyway. Besides, there is no one who compares to you. On 11/10/23, I realized that I
        really really liked you, and I knew that you were going to be my boyfriend.
        <br>
        <br>

        As we continued going on dates every Friday, I knew that I was falling for you even more. I enjoyed going
        out with you, and at times I felt like you knew Manhattan better than me, despite you being from Canada. I
        also loved laying in bed with you and doing absolutely nothing. I loved the fact that you would always hug
        and kiss me in the morning, despite not being a morning person, before checking your phone. I loved when you
        would pull me in closer when I was too far away on the bed, and all the times that you kissed me when you
        were half awake, for a brief second.
        <br>
        <br>

        I loved when you showered me with compliments and your usual you look incredible tonight. You have no idea
        how I feel about you every time we went out.
        <br>
        <br>

        Then I realized that I felt the same, and that I loved you.
        <br>
        <br>

        We experienced something that tested our relationship. I loved you so much to the point where I allowed
        myself to be 100% honest and vulnerable with you, knowing that there was a possibility that we may never
        speak again. I was ok with that because I pride myself on my strong morals and my commendable character.
        Also, I loved you so much, that I cared about your overall happiness, even if it was not with me. We
        continued our relationship, because your overall love for me was much stronger, and our relationship is
        stronger than ever.
        <br>
        <br>

        In my past, I have had people tell me that they loved me, but I now realize that it was not really love. I
        am now experiencing what it feels like to love someone, and to be loved properly. I&apos;m so overprotective
        of
        you, and our love is sacred.
        <br>
        <br>

        I know you love me when you watch my location and wait for me by your intercom, and watch me through the
        camera so that you can immediately buzz me in so that I don&apos;t have to ring your bell.
        <br>
        <br>

        I know that you love me when you pre-heat your apartment for me, because I am always cold, despite you
        disliking the heat.
        <br>
        <br>

        I know that you love me when you offer to help me with everything. You have offered to join a zoom call with
        my advisor for my graduate program, when I was in a rough position.
        <br>
        <br>

        I know you love me when you go out of your way to make phone calls, and do research to get me out of tricky
        situations.
        <br>
        <br>

        I know you love me when you do things to make my life easier, such as by gifting me a monitor for Christmas
        so that it is easier for me to read small lines of code, and when you paid for a hair appointment because
        you knew that I was trying to stick to a strict budget.
        I know you love me when you check on me after not hearing from me for awhile. You called the resort that I
        was staying in when I traveled to Cuba, to make sure that I arrived safely. You helped me with a school
        project because you are an excel wizard.
        <br>
        <br>

        Despite all of your actions that show me that you love me, I know that you love me because you tell me that
        everyday. I know you love me when I read your heartfelt love letters that bring me to tears of happiness. I
        know you love me because you read my book in such a short period of time, despite your long work hours. I
        knew that you loved me before you asked me to be your girlfriend on 2/13/24.
        <br>
        <br>

        I feel comfortable, and at peace when I am with you. I know that with you, I am safe, and I can be my most
        vulnerable self, without judgement. You make me feel beautiful, even with my natural hair, and even when I
        am critical of myself. You bring out the inner child in me, and I look forward to our conversations and
        moments together. I enjoy washing your hair for you, giving you haircuts, cleaning your apartment, and doing
        many other things without you asking, because I want to do everything with you and for you. You welcome my
        long rants and you encourage me to send everything to you. You like when I update you about my entire day
        and my thoughts in real-time, and you respond to every single one, even when I tell you that you do not have
        to. You make me feel like a happy puppy who is excited when their owner returns, or like a child who is
        happy to see their parent after school.
        <br>
        <br>

        I consider your needs, feelings, and wants, in everything that I do. I always hear you and feel you, even
        when you are not speaking, and even when we are miles apart. I always joke about how we are the same person
        because we are so in sync with each other. You make me want to be a better version of myself for me, but
        also for you. You have inspired me to start investing my money again, and to regularly check on the stocks
        that I currently own. You make me want to be kinder, smarter, and richer, and to be more consistent with
        exercise so that I am attractive for the rest of my life. Well, I always knew that I wanted to be hot even
        when I am older, but now I have someone to look hot for!
        <br>
        <br>

        I am the silliest and the best version of myself with you. Thank you for being patient with me, and for
        teaching me to communicate, instead of pretending like everything is fine, like I have done for my entire
        life. I do not have to pretend with you.
        <br>
        <br>
        You are the first person who I look forward to talking to when I wake up, and the last voice I love hearing
        before I fall asleep.
        <br>
        <br>

        I love you.
